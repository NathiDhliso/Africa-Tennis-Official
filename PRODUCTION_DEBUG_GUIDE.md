# Production Debugging Guide

## Console Logs Added for Production Debugging

I've added comprehensive console logs throughout your application to help debug the production error:

```
react-vendor-oUpGjgp3.js:1 Uncaught TypeError: (void 0) is not a function
```

## What to Look For

### 1. Application Initialization Logs
Look for these logs in order when the app starts:

```
[MAIN] React import validation: { React: "object", createRoot: "function", ... }
[MAIN] Starting application initialization
[MAIN] Environment: production
[MAIN] React version: 18.x.x
[MAIN] Root element found, creating React root
[MAIN] Loading App component
[MAIN] React app rendered successfully
```

### 2. Sentry Initialization
```
[APP] Initializing Sentry
[APP] Sentry initialized successfully
```

### 3. Authentication Flow
```
[APP] App component rendering
[AUTH STORE] Starting initialization
[AUTH STORE] Getting current session
[AUTH STORE] Session retrieved: true/false
[AUTH STORE] Initialization completed successfully
```

### 4. Error Tracking
If the error occurs, you'll see:

```
[GLOBAL ERROR] { message: "...", filename: "...", error: ... }
[ERROR BOUNDARY] { error: "...", stack: "..." }
[ERROR FALLBACK] Error caught by boundary: { ... }
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing React Import
If you see `React: "undefined"` in the import validation:
- **Cause**: React is not properly bundled
- **Solution**: Check your build configuration

### Issue 2: Auth Store Initialization Fails
If auth logs stop at "Starting initialization":
- **Cause**: Supabase client not properly configured
- **Solution**: Check environment variables

### Issue 3: Component Loading Fails
If you see "Loading App component" but no "App component rendering":
- **Cause**: Dynamic import failure
- **Solution**: Check code splitting configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build with Debug Logs**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Production**

3. **Open Browser Console** and look for the logs above

4. **Identify the Issue**:
   - Find where the logs stop
   - Look for any error messages
   - Check the global error handler output

## Environment Variables to Check

Make sure these are set in production:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (optional)
- `VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production`

## Removing Debug Logs

Once you've identified and fixed the issue, you can remove the debug logs by:

1. Search for `console.log('[` in your codebase
2. Remove or comment out the debug statements
3. Rebuild and redeploy

## Additional Debugging

If the logs don't reveal the issue:

1. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed resource loads
2. **Check Source Maps**: Ensure they're generated for better stack traces
3. **Enable Sentry**: For automatic error reporting
4. **Use React DevTools**: In production mode

## Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# Build and check for errors
npm run build

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Lint check
npm run lint

# Test locally with production build
npm run preview
```

The console logs will help you pinpoint exactly where the `(void 0) is not a function` error is occurring in your React application.
